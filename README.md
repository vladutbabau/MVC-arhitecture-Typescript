# MVC-arhitecture-Typescript

## Overview:

The project represents an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for developing Node.js applications using TypeScript. The MVC architecture is designed to ensure clear and modular code organization, facilitating the development, testing, and maintenance of projects.

## Key Features:

- Detailed implementation of the Model-View-Controller for handling data, user interface, and control logic.
- Utilization of TypeScript for type safety and more efficient code management.
- Connection to a local SQL database for data storage and management.

## Technologies Used:

1. Node.js
2. TypeScript
3. MySql

# Install Dependencies:

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.

Run the following commands in terminal to install dependencies: npm install
This command will automatically install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file, including "@types/node", "body-parser", "express", and "mysql".

# Database Configuration:

Make sure you have a local instance of MySQL available.
Check the database configuration file to ensure that the connection parameters are set correctly (host, user, password, database).
Run the Application:

After installing dependencies and configuring the database, you can start the application using: npm start
This command will start the server and make your application available at http://localhost:3000/ (or another configured port).

# Testing the Application:

Open a browser or use a tool like Postman to test different routes of the application.
